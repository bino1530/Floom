                </strong>
                <p>Before founding Floom, Bino spent several years creating high-profile campaigns for some of the world’s leading brands. But the seed for Floom was planted much earlier—back when Bino was working as an Executive PA and constantly frustrated by the lack of flower delivery options that were both convenient and beautifully arranged. That frustration bloomed into an idea, and in February 2016, Floom was launched. Since then, Bino and the team have been on a mission to deliver stunning, handcrafted bouquets to doorsteps around the globe. Whether you're sending flowers for Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, or just because, Floom is here to make every moment bloom with beauty.</p>
